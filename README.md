# Bank-Loan-Analysis

## Bank Loan Report: Problem Statement

## Objective:

To monitor and assess the bank’s lending activities, performance, and portfolio health by analyzing key loan-related metrics through a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide critical insights to help make data-driven decisions, identify trends, and optimize lending strategies.

## Dashboard 1: Summary

The main focus is to measure the bank’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications and funding:

Total Loan Applications: Calculate the number of loan applications over time and monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.

Total Funded Amount: Analyze the total loan amounts disbursed and their MoM variations.

Total Amount Received: Track the repayments made by borrowers, analyze MTD and MoM changes in total received amounts.

Average Interest Rate: Calculate the interest rate across loans and track MoM changes to understand lending portfolio costs.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate borrowers' financial health by calculating their DTI and observing its MoM variations.

## Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs

The report evaluates loan performance by distinguishing between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on loan status:

## Good Loan KPIs:

Includes metrics for fully paid and current loans.

Good Loan Application Percentage

Total Good Loan Applications

Good Loan Funded Amount

Good Loan Total Received Amount

## Bad Loan KPIs:

Includes metrics for loans classified as 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Application Percentage

Total Bad Loan Applications

Bad Loan Funded Amount

Bad Loan Total Received Amount

#### Loan Status Grid View

A grid view categorizes loans by status and presents metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, MTD Amounts, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI to help assess loan performance.

## Dashboard 2: Overview

To provide visual insights into various loan metrics, the report includes different chart types:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Show the trends in Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, and Amount Received over time to identify seasonal and long-term patterns.

Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Visualize the lending activities by state to assess regional disparities in loan distribution.

Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understand the distribution of loans across different terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).

Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Analyze how lending metrics vary among borrowers based on their employment history and length.

Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Break down loan metrics by the stated loan purposes, such as debt consolidation or credit card refinancing.

Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Show the impact of home ownership status (own, rent, mortgage) on loan applications and disbursements.
